<h3>App Guide</h3>
<hr/>
The filter on the left side allows you to search movie list.<br/>

Below that is the Add Movie button that displays a dialog box<br/>
that has the items that mirror the movie array (with a few addtions).<br/>

Each movie name is a clickable link that takes you to a product page<br/>

At the bottom of the homepage there is a pagination bar that allows you <br/>
adjust the amount of data you would like to view from the list.<br/>

The 'Movie Title, Genres, and Description' labels at the top of each column<br/>
are clickable and sort the column.
